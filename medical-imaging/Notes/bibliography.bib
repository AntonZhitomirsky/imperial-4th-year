              machine learning for medical imaging: scarcity of high-quality
              annotated data and mismatch between the development dataset and
              the target environment. A causal perspective on these issues
              allows decisions about data collection, annotation,
              preprocessing, and learning strategies to be made and scrutinized
              more transparently, while providing a detailed categorisation of
              potential biases and mitigation techniques. Along with worked
              clinical examples, we highlight the importance of establishing
              the causal relationship between images and their annotations, and
              offer step-by-step recommendations for future studies.",
